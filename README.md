## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 4

### What I learned
I learned how to use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap also how to make your website responsive. 

### Continued development

It is really true the saying that if you want to be good at coding you need to apply what you have learned in the past few days.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp Bootstrap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/bootstrap-4/) - This helped me on how to put BootStrap on the HTML and how to use bootstrap classes.
- [MDN Web Docs CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me in the CSS.
- [Github Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrb7Gge9yoE&t=235s) - This helped me how to upload repositories in Github.
